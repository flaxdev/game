# A new user-friendly tool for rapid modelling of ground deformation
GAME: Ground deformAtion ModElling

The software package is devoted to aid geoscientists in studying and rapidly inverting ground deformation data. The tool is developed in the MATLABÂ© framework and is oriented to an interactive, fast and user-friendly modelling approach based on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The software package is freely available and open source thus suitable for academic use (teaching and research).
The software can be easily used either to calculate the predictions from a model (i.e. forward/direct analysis) or to infer a model from data (i.e. inversion analysis).
